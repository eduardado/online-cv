  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Software Engineer with nearly 5 years of experience in the Java ecosystem. My expertise spans backend development (Spring Boot, REST APIs) and Java-based full-stack solutions (Vaadin, JavaFX, JSP). I have hands-on experience designing database schemas and building data-driven applications using diverse SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and Informix) and persistence frameworks (Hibernate, JPA, MyBatis).
    My background as a Clinical Scientist in the Biotechnology field has embedded a systematic, analytical, and highly detail-oriented approach to problem-solving, which I now apply to the full software development lifecycle.
    I am a proactive and collaborative developer dedicated to continuous improvement and delivering high-quality, robust software.
